The dataset utilized in this study is sourced from the IEEE repository, available at https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/heartdisease-dataset-comprehensive. This CSV file, last updated in November 2020, is openly accessible and falls under the Creative Commons license. Since its release, it has served as a foundational dataset for training and testing machine learning algorithms. Comprising 1190 instances and 11 variables, including age, gender, and blood pressure, this dataset amalgamates information from five commonly used datasets: Cleveland, Hungarian, Switzerland, Long Beach VA, and Statlog (Heart) Dataset. The selection of this dataset was driven by its incorporation of multiple industry-standard datasets for training purposes and its ease of accessibility. Noteworthy is the fact that due to the presence of null or empty values in some aspects of the five datasets, data cleaning is necessary before inputting it into the machine learning algorithm. Below is a basic understanding of each variable, and how to interpret it.

Implement the Fisher Scoring algorithm to create a predictive model capable of assessing the probability of heart diseases based on a diverse set of patient attributes.
Train the Fisher Scoring algorithm on the collected dataset to establish a reliable and accurate predictive model. Fine-tune the algorithm to optimize its performance in predicting the likelihood of heart diseases.
